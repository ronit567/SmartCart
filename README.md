# SmartCart - Setup Instructions

> **Prerequisites:** Youâ€™ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system before continuing.

To get started, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory: `git clone https://github.com/ronit567/SmartCart.git` then `cd SmartCart`.

Install all dependencies by running `npm install`.

Start the development server using `npm run dev`. After a few seconds, the app should be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified in your configuration).

To build the project for production, run `npm run build`.

If you encounter issues: verify that Node.js is installed correctly, change the port if the default is in use, and run `npm install` again if modules are missing.
